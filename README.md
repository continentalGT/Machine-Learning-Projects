# Machine-Learning-Projects
This  dataset is created by me.
I have learnt Data analytics and ML from 'DATA ANALYTICS WITH PYTHON ' from IIT Roorkee by Prof. A. Ramesh-.
Meanwhile Learning K-means I thought it Is good to apply on Lectures/videos stats. So I have collected data from lecture 1 to end based on Views and Likes (till 14 dec 2022) and Tried to cluster videos based on Likes and Views. Results are in notebook.
The Intention to do this self-experiment was just to fulfill my curiosity to understand K-Means .
Happy Learnin!!!
